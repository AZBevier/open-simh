   This module implements extensions to the base Simulation Control Program
   (SCP) front end for SIMH version 3.x.  The current extensions are:

     - host serial port support for the console and terminal multiplexers

     - automated prompt/response processing, initially for the system console,
       but extendable to other keyboard/display units

     - concurrent console mode to enter SCP commands without stopping simulation

     - work-alikes for a subset of the SCP 4.x commands

     - execution of a global initialization file at simulator startup

   This module, and its associated declarations file (sim_extension.h) act as
   shims between the front end and a simulator-specific back end, such as the HP
   2100 or HP 3000 simulator.  Each simulator back end must have this inclusion:

     #include "sim_extension.h"

   ...placed in the "<sim>_defs.h" file that is included by all back-end
   modules, and all back-end modules must be compiled with the inclusion.  Also,
   this module (sim_extension.c) must be compiled and linked with the other SCP
   and back-end modules.

   Extending SCP is possible by the use of hooks and shims.  SCP 3.x provides a
   number of replaceable function and variable pointers (the "hooks") that may
   be altered to implement custom behavior.  Hooks are necessary where the
   internal behavior of the SCP must change -- for example, when adding new
   command executors to the original table of commands.  A one-time initializer
   within this module is called by SCP at simulator startup.  This initializer
   points the desired hooks at functions within this module to implement the
   extended actions.

   To extend the capability at the interface between the SCP front end and the
   simulator-specific back end, shims are used to intercept the calls between
   them.  One call from the front end to the back end -- "sim_instr" -- is
   intercepted.  All of the other shims are for calls from the back end to
   front-end services or global variables set by the back end.  The general
   mechanism is to use a macro to rename a given function identifier within the
   context of the back end. The new name refers to the extension shim, which,
   internally, may call the original function.  For example, "sim_extension.h"
   includes this macro:

     #define sim_putchar       ex_sim_putchar

   ...which is included during the back-end compilation.  Therefore, a back-end
   module that called "sim_putchar" would actually be compiled to call
   "ex_sim_putchar", a function within this module, instead.  Within the shim,
   the macro substitution is not done, so a call to "sim_putchar" calls the
   front-end function.


   The following shims are provided:

     Shimmed Routine     Source Module   Shimming Routine
     ================    =============   =================
     tmxr_poll_conn      sim_tmxr.c      ex_tmxr_poll_conn

     sim_putchar         sim_console.c   ex_sim_putchar
     sim_putchar_s       sim_console.c   ex_sim_putchar_s
     sim_poll_kbd        sim_console.c   ex_sim_poll_kbd

     sim_brk_test        scp.c           ex_sim_brk_test

     sim_instr           hp----_cpu.c    vm_sim_instr
     sim_vm_init         hp----_sys.c    vm_sim_vm_init
     sim_vm_cmd          hp----_sys.c    vm_sim_vm_cmd


   The following extensions are provided:

     Extension Routine   Module Extended  Extended Action
     ==================  ===============  ===================================
     tmxr_attach_unit    sim_tmxr.c       Attach a network or serial port
     tmxr_detach_unit    sim_tmxr.c       Detach a network or serial port
     tmxr_detach_line    sim_tmxr.c       Detach a serial port
     tmxr_control_line   sim_tmxr.c       Control a line
     tmxr_line_status    sim_tmxr.c       Get a line's status
     tmxr_line_free      sim_tmxr.c       Check if a line is disconnected
     tmxr_mux_free       sim_tmxr.c       Check if all lines are disconnected


   The following extension hooks are provided:

     Hook Name                Hook Description
     ======================   ===========================
     vm_console_input_unit    Console input unit pointer
     vm_console_output_unit   Console output unit pointer


   The following SCP hooks are used:

     Hook Name           Source Module
     ================    =============
     sim_vm_init         scp.c
     sim_vm_cmd          scp.c
     sim_vm_unit_name    scp.c
     sub_args            scp.c
     sim_get_radix       scp.c

     tmxr_read           sim_tmxr.c
     tmxr_write          sim_tmxr.c
     tmxr_show           sim_tmxr.c
     tmxr_close          sim_tmxr.c
     tmxr_is_extended    sim_tmxr.c

   The extension hooks should be set by the back end to point at the console
   units.  They are used to identify the console units for the REPLY and BREAK
   commands.

   The VM-specific SCP hooks may be set as usual by the back end.  The extension
   module intercepts these but ensures that they are called as part of extension
   processing, so their effects are maintained.


   Implementation notes:

    1. If the base set of options to the SHOW CONSOLE command is changed in
       "scp.c", the "ex_show_console" routine below must be changed as well.
       See the routine's implementation note for details.

    2. The existing SCP command table model presents some difficulties when
       extending the command set.  When adding new commands that begin with the
       same letter(s) as existing commands, the existing commands must be
       duplicated in the extension table before the new ones.  This is required
       to preserve the standard command abbreviation behavior when the
       extension table is searched first.  For example, when adding a new CLEAR
       command, the existing CONTINUE command must be duplicated and placed
       ahead of the CLEAR entry, so that entering "C" invokes CONTINUE and not
       CLEAR.  But duplicating the CONTINUE entry introduces the potential for
       error if the standard CONTINUE entry is changed.  This means that
       duplicated entries must be copied dynamically, which then means that the
       new table cannot be a constant.

       Also, in some standard and extension cases, additional actions may need
       to be taken for specific commands.  The method of identifying the
       command by testing the "action" field of the resulting CTAB entry does
       not work if the command has been replaced.  For instance, testing
       "cmdp->action == &do_cmd" doesn't work if the DO command was replaced.
       The only reliable way is to test the "name" field for the expected
       command name string, i.e., testing "strcmp (cmdp->name, "DO") == 0",
       which is both slow and awkward.

       Further, new commands may be valid only in certain contexts, e.g., in a
       command file or only during some specific mode of execution.  There is
       no easy way of passing context to the command executor, except by global
       variables, as all executors receive the same parameters (an integer
       argument and a character pointer).

       In short, we have to jump through some hoops in implementing the command
       extensions.  These are described in the comments associated with their
       appearances.

   This structure extends the TMLN structure defined by the multiplexer library

   declarations in the various multiplexer simulators.  For lines controlled by
   extension routines, this pointer is changed to point at an EX_TMLN extension
   structure, which is defined below.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The name of the serial port is kept in an allocated buffer and referenced
       by the UNIT's "filename" pointer.  The "sername" pointer points at the
       same buffer; it is needed only to permit the "ex_tmxr_show" routine to
       print the name when given the TMLN structure.  This pointer must NOT be
       freed; the buffer is deallocated by freeing the "filename" pointer.

/* String breakpoint structure.

   String breakpoints are implemented by shimming the terminal output routines
   and matching each output character to a breakpoint string.  A string
   breakpoint structure holds the character string to be matched and some
   additional data that defines how the breakpoint is handled.  The structure is
   populated by a BREAK command having a quoted string parameter.  The structure
   may exist only until the breakpoint occurs (a "temporary" breakpoint) or
   until a NOBREAK command is issued to cancel it (a "permanent" breakpoint).
   Consequently, a breakpoint may be reused and so much contain enough
   information to allow the breakpoint to be reset after it triggers.

   The set of active breakpoint structures are maintained in a linked list
   headed by the "sb_list" global variable.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The structure contains some fields (e.g., "count") that are not used in
       the initial implementation.  They are present for future expansion.

    2. String breakpoints are initially implemented for the system console only.
       Future expansion to allow breakpoints on terminal multiplexer lines is
       envisioned.

    3. The trigger field contains the simulation global time at which a matched
       breakpoint should trigger.  It is set to -1 if the breakpoint has not yet
       matched (i.e., is still pending).

   reply is handled.  The structure is populated by a REPLY command having a

   completed.


   Implementation notes:

    1. Replies are initially implemented for the system console only.  Future
       expansion to allow replies on terminal multiplexer lines is envisioned.

    2. Only a single reply may exist in the initial implementation.  Multiple
       replies for different devices would be implemented by a linked-list of
       structures that are allocated dynamically.  Initially, though, the
       "reply" global points at a single static structure instead of the head of
       a list of structures.

    3. A reply is pending if "rptr" points at "reply [0]" and the current
       simulation time is earlier than the "trigger" time.

/* Command extension table.

   This table defines commands and command behaviors that are specific to this
   extension.  Specifically:

     * RUN and GO accept an UNTIL clause, and all forms provide a quiet DO mode

     * BREAK and NOBREAK provide temporary and string breakpoints

     * REPLY and NOREPLY provide console responses

     * DO provides transfers to labels and quiet stops

     * IF and GOTO add conditional command file execution

     * DELETE adds platform-independent file purges

     * CALL and RETURN add labeled subroutine invocations

     * ABORT stops execution of the current and any nested DO command files

     * SET adds ENVIRONMENT to define environment variables
       and CONSOLE CONCURRENT/NOCONCURRENT to set the console concurrency mode

     * SHOW adds string breakpoints to BREAK and adds REPLY for replies

   The table is initialized with only those fields that differ from the standard
   command table.  During one-time initialization, empty or zero fields are
   filled in from the corresponding standard command table entries.  This
   ensures that the extension table automatically picks up any changes to the
   standard commands that it modifies.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The RESET and DEPOSIT commands are duplicated from the standard SCP
       command table so that entering "R" doesn't invoke the RUN command and
       entering "D" doesn't invoke the DO command.  This would otherwise occur
       because the extension command table is searched before the standard
       command table.  Similarly, the ATTACH, ASSIGN, and ASSERT commands are
       duplicated so that entering "A" doesn't invoke the ABORT command.

    2. The "execute_file" routine needs to do special processing for the RUN,
       GO, STEP, CONTINUE, and BOOT commands.  Unfortunately, there is no easy
       way to determine these commands from their CTAB entries.  We cannot
       simply check the action routine pointers, because the VM may override
       them, potentially with five different routines.  We can't use special
       argument values, because they are used by the standard RUN executor to
       differentiate between the various commands (and they are not unique to
       these commands).  What we need is a VM extension field in the CTAB
       structure, but there isn't one.  So we rely on the hack that nothing in
       3.x uses the "help_base" field, which was added for 4.x compatibility. We
       therefore indicate a RUN, etc. command by setting the "help_base" field
       non-null (the actual value is, so far, immaterial).

/* *********************  Extension Module Initializer  ************************

   This routine is called once by the SCP startup code.  It fills in the
   extension command table from the corresponding system command table entries,
   saves pointers to the original system command handlers where needed, and
   installs the extension command table and argument substituter.

   If the VM defines an initializer, it is called.  Then if the VM set up its
   own command table, this routine merges the two auxiliary tables, ensuring
   that any VM-defined commands override the corresponding extension commands.
   This is required because SCP only allows a single user-specified command
   table.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The "ex_cmd_count" includes the NULL entry at the end of the extension
       command table, so adding in any VM command table entries gives the total
       command count plus one for the NULL entry, as is needed for the correct
       memory allocation size.

    2. Because the initializer is a void function, it cannot return an
       indication that the memory allocation failed.  If it did, the VM-defined
       command table will be ignored.

    3. For those overriding extension commands that will call the system command
       handlers (e.g., BREAK), we save the action routine pointers before
       installing the extension command table.  Similarly, those overriding VM
       commands that intend to call the system command handlers will save the
       corresponding action pointers.  However, because the extension table is
       installed before calling the VM initializer, the VM's action pointers
       will point at the extension command handlers.  So, for example, a BREAK
       command calls the VM BREAK handler, which in turn calls the extension
       BREAK handler, which in turn calls the system BREAK handler.

/* ********************  Terminal Multiplexer Extensions  **********************

   This module extends the following existing routines in "sim_tmxr.c":

     tmxr_poll_conn -- poll for new network or serial connections

   ...and adds the following new routines:

     tmxr_attach_unit   -- attach a network or serial port
     tmxr_detach_unit   -- detach a network or serial port
     tmxr_detach_line   -- detach a serial port
     tmxr_control_line  -- control a line
     tmxr_line_status   -- get a line' status
     tmxr_line_free     -- return TRUE if a specified line is disconnected
     tmxr_mux_free      -- return TRUE if all lines and network port are disconnected

   The module implementation requires that multiline multiplexers define a unit
   per line and that unit numbers correspond to line numbers.

   Multiplexer lines may be connected to terminal emulators supporting the
   Telnet protocol via sockets, or to hardware terminals via host serial ports.
   Concurrent Telnet and serial connections may be mixed on multiline
   multiplexers.

   When connecting via serial ports, individual multiplexer lines are attached
   to specific host ports using port names appropriate for the host system:

     sim> attach MUX2 com1      (or /dev/ttyS0)

   Serial port parameters may be optionally specified:

     sim> attach MUX2 com1;9600-8n1

   If the port parameters are omitted, then the host system defaults for the
   specified port are used.  The port is allocated during the attach call, but
   the actual connection is deferred until the multiplexer is polled for
   connections, as with Telnet connections.

   Individual lines may be disconnected from serial ports with:

     sim> detach MUX2

   Telnet and serial port connections may be dropped with:

     sim> set MUX2 DISCONNECT

   This will disconnect a Telnet client and will drop the Data Terminal Ready
   (DTR) signal on a serial port for 500 milliseconds.  The serial port remains
   attached to the line.


   Single-line devices may be attached either to a Telnet listening port or to a
   serial port.  The device attach routine may be passed either a port number or
   a serial port name.  This routine calls "tmxr_attach_unit".  If the return
   value is SCPE_OK, then a Telnet port number or serial port name was passed
   and was opened.  Otherwise, the attachment failed, and the returned status
   code value should be reported.

   The device detach routine calls "tmxr_detach_unit" to close either the Telnet
   listening port or the serial port.

   Multi-line devices with a unit per line and a separate poll unit attach
   serial ports to the former and a Telnet listening port to the latter.  Both
   types of attachments may be made concurrently.  The system ATTACH and DETACH
   commands are used, for example:

     sim> attach MUX 1050       -- attach the listening port
     sim> attach MUX0 com1      -- attach a serial port

   SCP passes the same pointer to unit 0 in both cases.  However, the SCP global
   variable "sim_ref_type" will indicate whether the device (REF_DEVICE) or a
   unit (REF_UNIT) was specified.  In the cases of a RESTORE or a DETACH ALL,
   where the user does not specify a device or unit, "sim_ref_type" will be set
   to REF_NONE.

   After a line is detached, the device simulator should clear the "rcve" field
   of the associated line descriptor.  However, detaching a listening port will
   disconnect all active Telnet lines but will not disturb any serial lines.
   Consequently, the device simulator cannot determine whether or not a
   multiplexer is active solely by examining the UNIT_ATT flag on the poll unit.
   Instead, the "tmxr_line_free" routine should be called for each line, and
   reception on the line should be inhibited if the routine returns TRUE.

   Finally, the "tmxr_mux_free" routine should be called to determine if the
   multiplexer is now free (i.e., the listening port is detached and no other
   serial connections exist).  If the routine returns TRUE, the poll service may
   be stopped.

   The "tmxr_attach_unit" and "tmxr_detach_unit" decide which type of port to
   use by examining the UNIT_ATTABLE flag on the supplied unit.  If the flag is
   present, then a Telnet port attach/detach is attempted.  If the flag is
   missing, then a serial port is assumed.  Multiline multiplexers therefore
   will specify UNIT_ATTABLE on the poll unit and not on the line units.

   Serial port connections are only supported on multiplexer lines that appear
   in the line connection order array.  If the line is not present, or the
   default value (i.e., -1 indicating all lines are to be connected) is not set,
   the attachment is rejected with a "Unit not attachable" error.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The system RESTORE command does not restore devices having the DEV_NET
       flag.  This flag indicates that the device employs host-specific port
       names that are non-transportable across RESTOREs.

       If a multiplexer specifies DEV_NET, the device connection state will not
       be altered when a RESTORE is done.  That is, all current connections,
       including Telnet sessions, will remain untouched, and connections
       specified at the time of the SAVE will not be reestablished during the
       RESTORE.  If DEV_NET is not specified, then the system will attempt to
       restore the attachment state present at the time of the SAVE, including
       Telnet listening and serial ports.  Telnet client sessions on individual
       multiplexer lines cannot be reestablished by RESTORE and must be
       reestablished manually.

    2. Single-line multiplexers must set or clear UNIT_ATTABLE on the unit
       representing the line dynamically, depending on whether a numeric
       (listening port) or non-numeric (serial port) value is specified.
       Multiline unit-per-line multiplexers should not have UNIT_ATTABLE on the
       units representing the lines.  UNIT_ATTABLE does not affect the
       attachability when VM-specific attach routines are employed, although it
       does determine which type of port is to be attached.  UNIT_ATTABLE also
       controls the reporting of attached units for the SHOW <dev> command.

       A single-line device will be either detached, attached to a listening
       port, or attached to a serial port.  With UNIT_ATTABLE, the device will
       be reported as "not attached," "attached to 1050" (e.g.), or "attached to
       COM1" (e.g.), which is desirable.

       A unit-per-line device will report the listening port as attached to the
       device (or to a separate device).  The units representing lines either
       will be connected to a Telnet session or attached to a serial port.
       Telnet sessions are not reported by SHOW <dev>, so having UNIT_ATTABLE
       present will cause each non-serial line to be reported as "not attached,"
       even if there may be a current Telnet connection.  This will be confusing
       to users.  Without UNIT_ATTABLE, attachment status will be reported only
       if the line is attached to a serial port, which is preferable.

/* Attach a network or serial port.

   This extension for "tmxr_attach" attempts to attach the network or serial
   port name specified by "cptr" to the multiplexer line associated with mux
   descriptor pointer "mp" and unit pointer "uptr".  The unit is implicitly
   associated with the line number corresponding to the position of the unit in
   the zero-based array of units belonging to the associated device.

   The validity of the attachment is determined by the presence or absence of
   the UNIT_ATTABLE ("unit is attachable") flag on the unit indicated by "uptr".
   The Telnet poll unit will have this flag; the individual line units will not.
   The presence or absence of the flag determines the type of attachment to
   attempt.

   If a device is referenced, the poll unit specified by the "pptr" parameter is
   attached instead of the referenced unit.  This is because a device reference
   passes a pointer to unit 0 (i.e., ATTACH MUX and ATTACH MUX0 both set "uptr"
   to point at unit 0).  If the poll unit is not defined, then the device attach
   is rejected.

   An attempt to attach the poll unit directly via a unit reference will be
   rejected by the "ex_tmxr_attach_line" routine because the unit does not
   correspond to a multiplexer port.

/* Control a terminal line.

   This extension routine controls a multiplexer line, specified by the "lp"
   parameter, as though it were connected to a modem.  The caller designates
   that the line's Data Terminal Ready (DTR) and Request To Send (RTS) signals
   should be asserted or denied as specified by the "control" parameter.  If the
   line is connected to a Telnet session, dropping DTR will disconnect the
   session.  If the line is connected to a serial port, the signals are sent to
   the device connected to the hardware port, which reacts in a device-dependent
   manner.

   Calling this routine establishes VM control over the multiplexer line.
   Control is only relevant when a line is attached to a serial port.

   Initially, a line is uncontrolled.  In this state, attaching a line to a
   serial port automatically asserts DTR and RTS, and detaching the line drops
   both signals.  After this routine has been called, this default action no
   longer occurs, and it is the responsibility of the VM to raise and lower DTR
   and RTS explicitly.

   The caller may reset a line to the uncontrolled state by calling the routine
   with the "control" parameter set to the "Reset_Control" value.  Typically,
   this is only necessary if a RESET -P (i.e., power-on reset) is performed.

   If a null pointer is passed for the "lp" parameter, the routine returns
   SCPE_IERR.  If the line extension structure has not been allocated when the
   routine is called, it is allocated here.  If the allocation fails, SCPE_MEM
   is returned.  If the line is attached to a serial port, the serial control
   routine status (SCPE_OK or SCPE_IOERR) is returned.  Otherwise, the routine
   returns SCPE_OK.

    1. The TMCKT and SERCIRCUIT types are renamings of the underlying
       RS232_SIGNAL type, so a type cast is valid.

/* Poll for a new network or serial connection.

   Implementation notes:

    1. When a serial port is attached to a line, the connection is made pending
       until we are called to poll for new connections.  This is because VM
       multiplexer service routines recognize new connections only as a result
       of calls to this routine.

    2. A pending serial (re)connection may be deferred.  This is needed when a
       line clear drops DTR, as DTR must remain low for a period of time in
       order to be recognized by the serial device.  If the "cnms" value
       specifies a time in the future, the connection is deferred until that
       time is reached.  This leaves DTR low for the necessary time.

    3. If the serial line is uncontrolled, the default control signals (i.e.,
       DTR and RTS) will be asserted.  Otherwise, the last signals set by the VM
       will be used.

/* Attach a line to a serial port.

   Attach a line of the multiplexer associated with mux descriptor pointer "mp"
   and unit pointer "uptr" to the serial port name indicated by "cptr".  The
   unit is implicitly associated with the line number corresponding to the
   position of the unit in the zero-based array of units belonging to the
   associated device.  For example, if "uptr" points to unit 3 in a given
   device, and "cptr" points to the string "COM1", then line 3 will be attached
   to serial port "COM1".

   An optional configuration string may be present after the port name.  If
   present, it must be separated from the port name with a semicolon and has
   this form:

      <rate>-<charsize><parity><stopbits>

   where:

     rate     = communication rate in bits per second
     charsize = character size in bits (5-8, including optional parity)
     parity   = parity designator (N/E/O/M/S for no/even/odd/mark/space parity)
     stopbits = number of stop bits (1, 1.5, or 2)

   As an example:

     9600-8n1

   The supported rates, sizes, and parity options are host-specific.  If a
   configuration string is not supplied, then host system defaults for the
   specified port are used.

   If the serial port allocation is successful, then the port name is stored in
   the UNIT structure, the UNIT_ATT flag is set, and the routine returns
   SCPE_OK.  If it fails, the error code is returned.

   Implementation notes:

    1. If the device associated with the unit referenced by "uptr" does not have
       the DEV_NET flag set, then the optional configuration string is saved
       with the port name in the UNIT structure.  This allows a RESTORE to
       reconfigure the attached serial port during reattachment.  The combined
       string will be displayed when the unit is SHOWed.

       If the unit has the DEV_NET flag, the optional configuration string is
       removed before the attached port name is saved in the UNIT structure, as
       RESTORE will not reattach the port, and so reconfiguration is not needed.

    2. The "exptr" field of the line descriptor will be set on entry if a call
       to the "ex_tmxr_control_line" routine has preceded this call.  If the
       structure has not been allocated, it is allocated here and is set to the
       uncontrolled state; a subsequent call to "ex_tmxr_control_line" will
       establish VM control if desired.

    3. Attempting to attach line that does not appear in the connection order
       array will be rejected.  This ensures that an omitted line will receive
       neither a Telnet connection nor a serial connection.

/* *********************  String Breakpoint Extensions  ************************

   This module extends the following existing routines in "sim_console.c" and
   "scp.c":

     sim_putchar   -- write a character to the console window
     sim_putchar_s -- write a character to the console window and stall if busy

     sim_brk_test  -- test for a breakpoint at the current program location

   The console output routines are extended to match output characters to
   pending string breakpoints, and the breakpoint test routine is extended to
   check for triggered string breakpoints.

   If a string breakpoint for the console is set, each output character is
   matched to the breakpoint string.  This matching takes place only if the
   console input has not been redirected to the command buffer, i.e., if it is
   in "Console" mode and not "Command" mode.  If the output characters form a
   matching string, the breakpoint is triggered, which will cause the next call
   to "sim_brk_test" to return the string breakpoint type.  The VM typically
   makes such a call once per instruction.

   If a breakpoint has a delay specified, triggering is not enabled until the
   delay time has expired.  The state of a breakpoint -- not triggered
   (pending), trigger delayed, or triggered -- is indicated by the "trigger"
   field of the breakpoint structure.  If the value is negative, the breakpoint
   is not triggered.  Otherwise, the value indicates the simulator global time
   at which the breakpoint transitions from trigger delayed to triggered.
   Comparison to the global time therefore indicates the trigger state.

   not done in Command mode to prevent a breakpoint from triggering due to
   command echoing or output.


   Implementation notes:

    1. If the output character cannot be written due to a stall, it is ignored.
       Output is normally stalled when the keyboard is in Command mode, so any
       characters output via calls to this routine while in Command mode will be

   Implementation notes:

/* Test for a breakpoint at the current location.

   This shim for "sim_brk_test" checks for a triggered string breakpoint or a
   numeric breakpoint of type "type" at the address designated by "location".
   If a breakpoint is detected, the type of the breakpoint is returned.

   The "type" parameter is the union of all numeric breakpoint types that are
   valid for this address location.  To be triggered, a numeric breakpoint must
   match both the location and one of the specified types.

   String breakpoints are always tested, as only one type of string breakpoint
   is defined -- the default string breakpoint type.  Therefore, it is not
   necessary for the VM to add the string breakpoint type to the "type"
   parameter when calling this routine.


   Implementation notes:

    1. For numeric breakpoint types, a type's presence in "sim_brk_summ"
       indicates that one or more breakpoints of that type are pending and must
       be checked for triggering during this routine.  For string breakpoints,
       presence of the BP_STRING type indicates that a string breakpoint has
       already triggered, and no further check is required.

    2. String breakpoints are triggered by the "breakpoint_service" routine when
       the breakpoint delay expires.  There would be no need to handle
       triggering here if there were a global breakpoint status value, as the
       service routine could simply return that hypothetical SCPE_BREAK code to
       stop instruction execution.  Unfortunately, "breakpoint triggered" is a
       VM-specific status code (e.g., STOP_BRKPNT), so we must use this routine
       to return a breakpoint indication to the VM, which then stops execution
       and returns its own VM-specific status.

/* Service a breakpoint.

   A matched breakpoint remains in the trigger-delayed state until any specified
   delay elapses.  When a pending breakpoint is satisfied, service is scheduled
   on the breakpoint unit to wait until the delay expires.  This service routine
   then triggers the breakpoint and handles removal of the allocated structure
   if it is temporary or resetting the breakpoint if it is permanent.

   On entry, one of the breakpoints in the linked list will be ready to trigger.
   We scan the list looking for the first breakpoint whose trigger time has
   passed.  The scan is done only if no prior trigger is waiting to be
   acknowledged.  This condition could occur if the VM has not called
   "sim_brk_test" since the earlier breakpoint triggered.  In that case, we
   postpone our check, so that we do not have two triggered breakpoints at the
   same time (as only one of the two sets of breakpoint actions can be
   performed).

   When a breakpoint triggers, the BP_STRING type is set in the "sim_brk_summ"
   variable to tell the "sim_brk_test" routine to pass a breakpoint indication
   back to the VM for action.  Then we clean up the breakpoint structure,
   copying the action string into a local static buffer if the breakpoint was
   temporary; it will be executed from there.

   When we are called, there may be additional breakpoints in the trigger-
   delayed state, i.e., waiting for their respective delays to expire before
   triggering.  While we are processing the breakpoint list, we also look for
   the earliest breakpoint in that state and schedule our service to reactivate
   when that delay expires.  If no additional breakpoints are delayed, the
   service stops.


   Implementation notes:

    1. If a second breakpoint is waiting, the delay until that breakpoint
       triggers could be zero -- if, for example, a breakpoint with a delay of
       2000 has already waited for a period of 1000 when a second breakpoint
       with a delay of 1000 is satisfied.  After servicing the first breakpoint,
       we cannot reactivate the service with a zero time, because we would be
       reentered before the VM had a chance to call "sim_brk_test" and so the
       first would still be pending, which would hold off recognizing the
       second.  This would result in another zero service time, and the VM would
       never get an opportunity to recognize any breakpoints.  So we arbitrarily
       reschedule with a delay of one, which allows the VM to recognize the
       first triggered breakpoint.

    2. It is safe to use a single static breakpoint action buffer for temporary
       breakpoints, because a triggered breakpoint causes the VM to exit the
       instruction loop, and reentry (a necessary condition for a second
       breakpoint to trigger) clears any pending actions.

/* Test for a string breakpoint.

   This routine is called when string breakpoints exist and a character is to be
   output.  It checks for a match between that character (the test character)
   and the next character in each match string in the linked list of breakpoint
   structures.  If a match string is completed, the breakpoint enters the
   trigger-delayed state, and the break delay timer is scheduled if it is not
   running.  Matching a particular breakpoint does not inhibit matching against
   all of the other breakpoints.

   Within each STRING_BREAKPOINT structure in the linked list of breakpoints,
   the "match" field contains the string to match, and the "mptr" field points
   at the next character to check (initially, the first character of the match
   string).

   If the test character equals the match character, then the match pointer is
   advanced.  If the pointer now points at the end of the match string, then the
   breakpoint enters the trigger delayed state.  The "trigger" field is set to
   the trigger activation time.  This is normally the current time but will be a
   time in the future if a breakpoint delay was specified.  If no other
   breakpoint is in this state, the break delay timer will not be active, and so
   the routine will activate it with the specified delay.  If the timer is
   already active, the remaining delay time is compared to the delay time for
   the newly matched breakpoint.  If the remaining time is greater, the timer is
   reset to the shorter delay, as the new breakpoint will trigger before the
   existing one.  Otherwise, the timer continues with the remaining time.

   If the test character does not equal the current match character, then a
   check is made to see if it matches any prior characters in the match string.
   If it does not, then the match pointer is reset to the start of the string.
   However, if it does, then it's possible that the characters output so
   far match a prior substring of the match string.

   Consider a match string of "ABABC" that has been matched through the second
   "B", so that the match pointer points at the "C".  We are called with an "A"
   as the test character.  It does not match "C", but in looking backward, we
   see that it does match the second "A".  So we search backward from there to
   see if the output characters match the earlier part of the match string.  In
   this case, the last three characters output match the leading substring "ABA"
   of the match string, so the match pointer is reset to point at the fourth
   character, rather than the second.  Then, if "BC" is subsequently output, the
   match will succeed.

   Conceptually, this search begins with:

                   match pointer
                         |
             A  B  A  B  C      match characters
             A  B  A  B  A      output characters
                         |
                  test character

   Because the characters do not match, we "slide" the output string to the left
   to see if we can find a trailing output substring that matches a leading
   match substring.  We start with the right-most match character that equals
   the test character

         first matching character
                   |
             A  B  A  B  C      match characters
       A  B  A  B  A            output characters
             |  |  |
              match

   Here, the last three output string characters match the first three match
   string characters, so we reset the match pointer to the fourth character:

                match pointer
                      |
             A  B  A  B  C      match characters

   Now if an additional "B" and "C" are output (i.e., the entire output is
   "ABABABC"), then the breakpoint will trigger on receipt of the "C".

             A  B  A  B  C      match characters
       A  B  A  B  A  B  C      output characters
             |  |  |  |  |
                 match

   Now consider a match string of "ABAB" that has matched through the second
   "A", and we are called with a test character of "A":

                    match pointer
                          |
                 A  B  A  B     match characters
                 A  B  A  A     output characters
                          |
                   test character

   The first substring test does not match:

             first matching character
                       |
                 A  B  A  B     match characters
              A  B  A  A        output characters
                 |  |
               no match

   So we search backward for another test character match and try again, and
   this one succeeds:

     second matching character
                 |
                 A  B  A  B     match characters
        A  B  A  A              output characters
                 |
               match

   The match pointer is reset to point at the following "B", and the breakpoint
   will trigger if the subsequent output produces "ABAABAB".

   Effectively, the search starts with the longest possible substring and then
   attempts shorter and shorter substrings until either a match occurs or no
   substring matches.  In the first case, the match pointer is reset
   appropriately, and partial matching continues.  In the second, the match
   pointer is reset to the beginning of the match string, and a new match is
   sought.

   Searching for the longest substring that matches the output stream would
   appear to require an output history buffer.  However, the fact that all of
   the prior output characters until the current one have matched means that the
   match string itself IS the history of the relevant part of the output stream.
   We need only search for substrings that equal the substring of the match
   string that ends with the last-matched character.

   This matching process is repeated for each node in the list of breakpoints.

/* *************  Concurrent Console Mode and Reply Extensions ****************

   This module extends the following existing routines in "hp----_cpu.c" and
   "sim_console.c":

     sim_instr    -- execute simulated machine instructions

     sim_poll_kbd -- poll the console keyboard for input

   The instruction execution routine is extended to process commands entered in
   concurrent console mode.  The keyboard poll routine is extended to allow
   entry of commands concurrently with instruction execution and also to supply
   previously established character string replies automatically.

   In the normal console mode, entry of SCP commands first requires instruction
   execution to be stopped by entering the WRU character (default is CTRL+E).
   This prints "Simulation stopped" on the console, terminates instruction
   execution, and returns to the "sim>" prompt.  At this point, a command such
   as a tape image attachment may be entered, and then execution may be resumed.

   The problem with this is that while instruction execution is stopped, the
   simulated time-of-day clock is also stopped.  It that clock had been set
   accurately at target OS startup, it will lose time each time an SCP command
   must be entered.

   To alleviate this, a "concurrent" console mode may be established.  In this
   mode, entering CTRL+E does not terminate instruction execution but rather
   diverts console keystrokes into a separate command buffer instead of
   returning them to the VM.  During command entry, instructions continue to
   execute, so the simulated time-of-day clock remains accurate.  When the
   command is terminated with ENTER, the VM's "sim_instr" routine returns to the
   extension shim.  The shim executes the command and then automatically resumes
   instruction execution.  The simulated clock is stopped for the command
   execution time, but that time is usually shorter than one clock tick and so
   is absorbed by the clock calibration routine.

   The extended keyboard poll routine switches between "Console" mode, where the
   characters are delivered to the VM, and "Command" mode, where the characters
   are delivered to a command buffer.  Entry into command mode is made by
   sensing CTRL+E, and exit from command mode is made by sensing ENTER.  Limited
   editing is provided in Command mode because the poll routine obtains
   characters, not keystrokes, and so can't sense the non-character keys such as
   the arrow keys.

   Concurrent console mode is an option, set by the SET CONSOLE [NO]CONCURRENT
   command.
*/


/* Global concurrent console and reply extension routines */


/* Execute CPU instructions.

   This shim for the virtual machine's "sim_instr" routine detects commands
   entered in concurrent console mode, executes them, and then calls "sim_instr"
   again.  This loop continues until a simulation stop condition occurs.


   Implementation notes:

    1. On Unix systems, WRU is registered as the SIGINT character, so CTRL+E
       does not arrive via the keyboard poll.  Instead, the SIGINT handler
       installed by the "run_cmd" routine is called, which sets the "stop_cpu"
       flag.  This value is tested in "sim_process_event", which returns
       SCPE_STOP in response.  This causes the VM's "sim_instr" to stop
       execution and print "Simulation stopped" before returning.  We cannot
       test "stop_cpu" in our "ex_sim_poll_kbd" routine to trigger the
       concurrent mode prompt because "sim_process_event" is called after every
       machine instruction, so it will be seen there before we can act on it in
       our keyboard poll.  So instead we must replace the installed SIGINT
       handler with one of our own that sets a local "stop_requested" flag that
       is tested in our keyboard poll.

    2. When the system console is connected to a serial port, we fake a Telnet
       connection by setting "sim_con_tmxr.master" non-zero during instruction
       execution.  This tricks the "sim_poll_kbd" and "sim_putchar[_s]" routines
       in "sim_console.c" into calling the terminal multiplexer routines, which
       will read from or write to the serial console.

    3. Leading spaces must be skipped before calling "get_glyph" to parse the
       command keyword, as that routine uses spaces to mark the end of the
       keyword.  If a leading space is present, "get_glyph" will return a null
       string as the keyword, and "find_cmd" (called via "get_command") will
       return a successful match with the first entry in the command table.

    4. The routine must restore the console to "command mode" to reenable text
       mode on the console log, which is necessary to obtain the correct line
       ends on logged commands.  It must also save and restore the command line
       switches in effect at entry, so that any switches present in the entered
       command line aren't incorrectly used by the VM's "sim_instr" routine.

    5. With one exception, entered commands must be "unrestricted", i.e., must
       not interfere with the partial unwinding of the VM run state.  The
       exception is the DO command.  To allow command files to contain
       prompt/response actions, we handle DO specially by setting the global
       "concurrent_do_ptr" to point at the DO command line and then stop
       execution to unwind the run state.  The DO command is then handled in the
       "ex_run_cmd" routine by executing the command file and then automatically
       reentering this routine to resume instruction execution.

    7. We can't simply return SCPE_EXIT in response to an EXIT command because
       the standard "run_cmd" routine ignores the return status and always
       returns SCPE_OK to the command loop.  To get the loop to exit, we could
       either set a global here and return SCPE_EXIT from "ex_run_cmd" in
       response, or set up EXIT as a "breakpoint" action to be executed upon
       return.  The latter option is implemented.

/* Poll the console keyboard.

   This shim for "sim_poll_kbd" polls the console keyboard for keystrokes and
   delivers the resulting characters to the caller.  The routine extends the
   standard one to supply automatic responses for the REPLY command and to
   enable a "concurrent" command mode that allows SCP commands to be entered
   without stopping simulation execution.

   During simulator execution, the system console is connected to the simulation
   console by default.  While it is so connected, keystrokes entered at the
   simulation console are delivered to the system console device.

   With a SET CONSOLE TELNET command, the system console may be redirected to a
   Telnet port.  After this separation, two console windows exist: the
   simulation console remains attached to the originating command window, while
   the system console is attached to the Telnet client window.  When the system
   console window has the input focus, keystrokes are delivered to the system
   console device.  When the simulation console window has the focus, keystrokes
   are delivered to SCP.

   In non-concurrent mode, SCP responds only to CTRL+E and ignores all other
   keystrokes.  If concurrent mode is enabled with a SET CONSOLE CONCURRENT
   command, then the simulation console becomes interactive after a CTRL+E while
   simulator execution continues.  During this time, system console operation
   depends on whether the simulation and system consoles are joined or
   separated.

   In concurrent mode, the simulation console is in one of two states: Console
   or Command.  It starts in Console state.  If the simulation and system
   consoles are joined, then keystrokes are delivered to the system console.  If
   they are separated, then keystrokes are ignored.

   Pressing CTRL+E prints an "scp> " prompt on the simulation console, and the
   console switches to the Command state.  While execution continues, keystrokes
   forming an SCP command are placed in a command buffer; the command is
   executed when ENTER is pressed.  Limited editing is provided in the Command
   state.  Pressing BACKSPACE deletes the last character entered, and pressing
   ESCAPE clears all characters.  Pressing ENTER with no characters present
   terminates the Command state and returns to the Console state.

   In the Command state, if the simulation and system console are joined, then
   the system console device will not receive any keyboard input, and any
   console output call will return with an SCPE_STALL result.  To the user,
   pressing CTRL+E pauses any output in progress to the system console, which
   resumes automatically after the entered command is executed.  If the
   simulation and system console are separate, then the system console continues
   to function normally while the command is being entered at the simulation
   console.

   Pressing CTRL+E while in the Command state causes a simulation stop, just as
   it does in non-concurrent mode.  The console is returned to Console state,
   and any partially entered command is abandoned.

   While in Console mode, this routine supplies characters from a prior REPLY
   command as though they were typed by the user.  This allows command files to
   contain automated prompt/response pairs for console interaction.

   If a reply exists, a check is made to ensure that any specified reply delay
   has been met.  If it hasn't, then keyboard polling is performed normally.  If
   it has, or if we are in the middle of a reply, the next character in the
   reply string is returned to the caller.  If the next character is a NUL, then
   the reply is exhausted, and the reply context is cleared.


   Implementation notes:

    1. It would be nice to have better editing capability in Command mode, e.g.,
       to be able to recall from a command history and edit the resulting line.
       Unfortunately, the standard "sim_poll_kbd" routine returns characters and
       not keystrokes, so it is impossible to detect, e.g., an up-arrow key.  It
       might be easy to implement a one-line recall command by restoring the
       command buffer to the state just prior to ENTER, though then only the
       usual editing (BS and typing replacements) would be available.

    2. Currently, only a reply to a single device (the console) is allowed, so
       the reply list head pointer is used directly.  In the future, a linked
       list of reply structures will be used, and the routine will have to
       search the list for the one matching the console unit.

   This routine is a SIGINT handler that is installed to detect CTRL+E on Unix
   systems and CTRL+C on others.  It is used in place of the standard
   "int_handler" routine.  That routine sets the global "stop_cpu" flag, which
   is tested in "sim_process_event" and causes simulated execution to stop.  For
   concurrent console operation, we must detect the condition without setting
   the global flag.  So this routine sets a local flag that is tested by our
   "ex_sim_poll_kbd" routine to switch from Console to Command mode.

   It is also used in our "execute_file" command to abort a DO command file that
   may be stuck in an infinite loop.


   Implementation notes:

    1. On Unix systems, WRU is registered as the SIGINT character, so CTRL+E
       does not arrive via the keyboard poll.  Instead, a SIGINT handler is
       used, which is why we need this handler to detect initiation of Command
       mode on Unix.

stop_requested = TRUE;                                  /* indicate that WRU was seen */
return;                                                 /*   and continue execution */

/* Get a command descriptor.

   This routine searches for the command whose name is indicated by the "cptr"
   parameter and copies the corresponding command descriptor (CTAB) entry
   pointer into the pointer variable designated by the "cmdp" pointer.  If the
   command is not found, the routine sets the pointer variable to NULL and
   returns SCPE_UNK (Unknown command).  If the command is found but is
   restricted, the routine returns SCPE_NOFNC (Command not allowed).  Otherwise,
   the routine returns SCPE_OK.

   This routine is similar to the standard "find_cmd" routine, except that it
   also checks to see if the simulator is currently running and, if so, that the
   command is in the list of unrestricted commands.  A command entered while the
   simulator is running must not interfere with execution; those that do are
   deemed "restricted" commands.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The unrestricted ("allowed") command list is structured as a simple
       string, with the command names preceded and followed by spaces.  This
       allows a simple "strstr" search to look for a match.

    2. We search the list of unrestricted commands for the full command name to
       avoid false matches by, e.g., searching for the entered command "R"
       instead of "RUN".  We also add leading and trailing blanks before
       searching to ensure that we haven't matched a substring of an
       unrestricted command (although currently there are no restricted commands
       that are substrings of unrestricted commands).

    3. The "cptr" parameter cannot be declared "const" because it is passed to
       "find_cmd", which takes a non-const pointer.

/* ************************  SCP Command Extensions  ***************************

   This module extends the following existing commands:

     RUN      -- reset and start simulation
     GO       -- start simulation
     STEP     -- execute <n> instructions
     CONTINUE -- continue simulation
     BOOT     -- bootstrap simulation
     BREAK    -- set breakpoints
     NOBREAK  -- clear breakpoints
     DO       -- execute commands in a file
     SET      -- set simulator options
     SHOW     -- show simulator options

   ...and adds the following new commands:

     REPLY   -- send characters to the console
     NOREPLY -- cancel a pending reply
     IF      -- execute commands if condition TRUE
     DELETE  -- delete a file
     GOTO    -- transfer control to the labeled line
     CALL    -- call the labeled subroutine
     RETURN  -- return control from a subroutine
     ABORT   -- abort nested command files
     FLUSH   -- flush all buffered files

   The RUN and GO commands are enhanced to add an UNTIL option that sets a
   temporary breakpoint, and all of the simulated execution commands are
   enhanced to save and restore an existing SIGINT handler that may be in effect
   within a DO command file.  The BREAK and NOBREAK commands are enhanced to
   provide temporary and string breakpoints.  DO is enhanced to provide GOTO,
   CALL, RETURN, and ABORT commands that affect the flow of control.  SET and
   SHOW are enhanced to provide access to environment variables, to provide
   serial support to the system console, and to provide a concurrent command
   mode during simulated execution.

   The new REPLY and NOREPLY commands enable and disable automated responses
   from the system console.  IF provides conditional command execution.  DELETE
   provides a host-independent method of deleting a file, such as a temporary or
   scratch file.

   Also, an extension is provided to add optional binary data interpretation to
   the existing octal, decimal, and hexadecimal command-line overrides.

   In addition, command-line parameter substitution is extended to provide a set
   of substitution variables that yield the current date and time in various
   formats, as well as environment variable values.  Combined with the new SET
   ENVIRONMENT and IF commands, arbitrary variable values may be set, tested,
   and used to affect command file execution.
*/


/* Global SCP command extension handler routines */


/* Execute the BREAK and NOBREAK commands.

   This command processing routine enhances the existing BREAK and NOBREAK
   commands to provide temporary and string breakpoints.  The routine processes
   commands of the form:

     BREAK { -T } <address-list> { ; <action> ... }
     BREAK { -T } <quoted-string> { ; <action> ... }
     BREAK { -T } <quoted-string> DELAY <delay> { ; <action> ... }
     BREAK DELAY <delay>
     NOBREAK <quoted-string>
     NOBREAK ""
     NOBREAK ALL

   Where:

     -T    = indicates that the breakpoint is temporary

     delay = the number of event ticks that elapse after the breakpoint is
             satisfied before execution is stopped; default is 0

   The new "-T" breakpoint type switch indicates that the breakpoint will be set
   temporarily.  A temporary breakpoint is removed once it occurs; this is
   equivalent to setting the (first) breakpoint action to NOBREAK.  Without
   "-T", the breakpoint is persistent and will cause a simulation stop each time
   it occurs.

   String breakpoints cause simulator stops when the character sequences are
   encountered in the system console output stream; these are similar to stops
   that occur when CPU execution reaches specified memory addresses.

   The first string form sets a breakpoint that stops simulator execution when
   the content of the quoted string appears in the system console output.  By
   default, the simulator stops immediately after the final character of the
   quoted string is output.  The second string form may be used to insert a
   delay of the specified number of event ticks (e.g., machine instructions)
   before execution stops.  The delay is set temporarily for that breakpoint; it
   then reverts to a zero delay for subsequent breakpoints.

   If all of the string breakpoints for a program require a delay, it may be set
   as the new default by using the BREAK DELAY command.

   The optional action commands are executed when the breakpoint occurs.  If the
   breakpoint is temporary, the actions are executed once; otherwise, they
   execute each time the breakpoint occurs.

   The first NOBREAK command form cancels the string breakpoint specified by the
   quoted string.  The second form cancels all string breakpoints; the empty
   quoted string is required to differentiate between canceling string
   breakpoints and canceling the current address breakpoint.  The NOBREAK ALL
   command cancels all string breakpoints in addition to canceling all address
   breakpoints.

   Specifying a quoted string in a BREAK command that matches an existing
   breakpoint replaces the delay and actions of that breakpoint with the values
   specified in the new BREAK command.  It does not create a second breakpoint
   with the same string.


   Implementation notes:

    1. Currently, only one type of string breakpoint is defined (the implicit
       "BP_STRING" type), although we include all command-line switches in the
       "type" field of the breakpoint structure for future use.

    2. A NOBREAK command specifying a breakpoint string that does not match any
       existing breakpoint succeeds with no warning message to be consistent
       with the behavior of NOBREAK <address> that does match an existing
       breakpoint.

/* Execute the REPLY and NOREPLY commands.

   This command processing routine adds new REPLY and NOREPLY commands to
   automate replies through the system console when programmatic input is next
   requested by the target OS.  The routine processes commands of the form:

     REPLY <quoted-string>
     REPLY <quoted-string> DELAY <delay>
     REPLY DELAY <delay>
     NOREPLY

   Where:

     delay = the number of event ticks that must elapse before the first
             character of the reply is sent; default is 0

   The first form supplies the content of the quoted string to the system
   console, character by character, as though entered by pressing keys on the
   keyboard.  By default, the first character is supplied to the console device
   immediately after simulation is resumed with a GO or CONTINUE command.  The
   second form may be used to insert a delay of the specified number of event
   ticks (e.g., machine instructions) before the first character is supplied.

   If the second form is used, the delay is set temporarily for that reply; it
   then reverts to a zero delay for subsequent replies.  If all of the replies
   to a program require a delay, it may be set as the new default by using the
   third form.

   The NOREPLY command cancels any pending reply.  Replies are also effectively
   canceled when they are consumed.


   Implementation notes:

    1. Currently, only a reply to a single device (the console) is allowed, so
       the reply list head pointer is set to point at a static structure.  In
       the future, the structures will be allocated and deallocated dynamically.

/* Execute the RUN, GO, STEP, CONTINUE, and BOOT commands.

   This command processing routine enhances the existing RUN and GO commands to
   provide optional temporary breakpoints.  The routine processes RUN and GO
   commands of the form:

     GO UNTIL <stop-address> { ; <action> ... }
     GO UNTIL <quoted-string> { ; <action> ... }
     GO UNTIL <quoted-string> DELAY <delay> { ; <action> ... }
     GO <start-address> UNTIL <stop-address> { ; <action> ... }
     GO <start-address> UNTIL <quoted-string> { ; <action> ... }
     GO <start-address> UNTIL <quoted-string> DELAY <delay> { ; <action> ... }

   The "GO UNTIL" command is equivalent to "BREAK -T" and "GO".  Multiple
   <stop-address>es, separated by commas, may be specified.  For example, "GO 5
   UNTIL 10,20" sets temporary breakpoints at addresses 10 and 20 and then
   resumes simulator execution at address 5.  As with the BREAK command,
   specifying a DELAY value sets a temporary delay of the specified number of
   event ticks before execution stops.  If a DELAY value is not given, the
   breakpoint uses the default delay set by an earlier BREAK DELAY command, or a
   zero delay if the default has not been overridden.

   The STEP, CONTINUE, and BOOT commands are unaltered.  They are handled here
   so that all execution commands may set the "SIM_SW_HIDE" command switch to
   suppress step and breakpoint messages while executing in command files.  This
   allows automated prompt/response pairs to be displayed without cluttering up
   the output with intervening "Step completed" and "Breakpoint" messages.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The DO executor sets a SIGINT handler to permit interrupting an infinite
       command loop.  We save and restore this handler around the call to the
       standard RUN command handler because that routine restores the default
       handler instead of the previous handler when it completes.  This action
       would cancel the DO executor's handler installation if we did not save
       and restore it here.

       We save the prior handler by installing the default handler, which is the
       condition the standard RUN handler expects on entry.

    2. A DO command in concurrent mode must be handled outside of the VM's
       instruction execution routine.  This is because we want to permit
       unrestricted commands, such as GO UNTIL, to enable prompt/response
       entries in the command file.  But we cannot execute the DO command after
       exiting our routine, e.g., by setting up the command as a breakpoint
       action and then returning, because if we've been called by an enclosing
       command file, returning will advance the file pointer, so that the
       command that invoked us won't be reexecuted.  Instead, we must call the
       DO command processor here and then reenter the instruction execution
       routine if no error exists.

    3. The DO command handler clears "sim_switches" for each command invocation,
       so we must save the run switches and restore them after handling a
       concurrent DO command.

    4. The global "concurrent_run" flag may be examined within a DO command file
       executing in concurrent mode.  The flag is initially FALSE.  We save and
       restore the flag on entry and exit to ensure that it remains TRUE if
       simulation is stopped within the DO file (if we set it FALSE on exit, it
       would show FALSE when examined after a command file breakpoint (e.g.),
       even though we were still executing within the context of a
       currently-running session, which would resume when the DO file is
       finished.

    5. All errors from a concurrent DO file invocation are reported but do not
       stop CPU execution.  The exception is the EXIT command, which not only
       stops the CPU but also exits the simulator (the alternative would be to
       treat EXIT as a NOP, but then the DO file would exhibit different
       behavior, depending on whether or not it was invoked in concurrent mode).

/* Execute the DO command.

   This command processing routine enhances the existing DO command to permit
   CTRL+C to abort a command file or a nested series of command files.  The
   actual command file processing is handled by a subsidiary routine.

   It also executes commands in a new global initialization file at system
   startup.  It looks for the file "simh.ini" in the current directory; if not
   found, it then looks for the file in the HOME or USERPROFILE directory.  The
   file is optional; if it exists, it is executed before the command-line file
   or the simulator-specific file.

   Therefore, the search order for "simh.ini" is the current directory first,
   then the HOME directory if the HOME variable exists, or else the USERPROFILE
   directory if that variable exists.  So a user may override a "simh.ini" file
   present in the HOME or USERPROFILE directories by one in the current
   directory.

   An error encountered in the global initialization file is reported and stops
   execution of that file but does not inhibit execution of the simulator-
   specific initialization file.

   On entry, the "cptr" parameter points at the invocation string after the DO
   keyword.  The "file" parameter is NULL to indicate that the routine is to
   open the filename present at the start of the "cptr" string.  The "flag"
   parameter indicates the source of the call and nesting level and contains one
   of these values:

     < 0 = initialization file (no alternate if not found)
       0 = startup command line file
       1 = "DO" command
     > 1 = nested DO or CALL command

   For a nested command call, "flag" contains the nesting level in bits 0-3 and
   the value of the invoking switches in bits 4-29.  This allows the switch
   settings to propagate to nested command files.


   Implementation notes:

    1. This routine is always called during system startup before the main
       command loop is entered.  It is called to execute the command file
       specified on the command line, or, if there is none, the command file
       associated with the simulator (e.g., "hp2100.ini").  The call occurs even
       if neither of these files exist.  We detect this initial call and execute
       the global initialization file before either of these command files.

    2. We save the command-line switches before executing the global
       initialization file, so that they will apply to the command-line file or
       the local initialization file.  Otherwise, execution of a command in the
       global file would reset the switches before the second file is executed.

    3. The invocations of the global and command/simulator files are considered
       to be separate executions.  Consequently, an ABORT in the global file
       terminates that execution but does not affect execution of the
       command/simulator file.

    4. If the simulator was invoked with command-line parameters, we pass them
       to the global initialization file.  So, for example, "%1" will be the
       command filename that will be executed, "%2" will be the first parameter
       passed to that file, etc.  In this case, the "flag" parameter will be 0.
       If we are called to execute the simulator-specific initialization file,
       then there must not have been any command-line parameters, and "flag"
       will be -1.

    5. We use a filename buffer of twice the standard size, because the home
       path and the command-line parameter string may each be up to almost a

/* Execute the IF command.

   This command processing routine adds a new IF command to test a condition and
   execute the associated command(s) if the condition is true.  The routine
   processes commands of the form:

     IF { -I } <comparative-expression> <action> { ; <action> ... }

   Where the comparative expression forms are:

     <Boolean-expression>
     <Boolean-expression> <logical> <comparative-expression>

   ...and the Boolean expression forms are:

     <quoted-string> <equality> <quoted-string>
     <quoted-string> IN <quoted-string> { , <quoted-string> ...}
     <quoted-string> NOT IN <quoted-string> { , <quoted-string> ...}
     EXIST <quoted-string>
     NOT EXIST <quoted-string>

   The logical operators are && (And) and || (Or).  The equality operators are
   == (equal to) and != (not equal to).

   The IN operation returns true if the first quoted string is equal to any of
   the listed quoted strings, and the NOT IN operation returns true if the first
   quoted string is not equal to any of the listed strings.

   The EXIST operation returns true if the file specified by the quoted string
   exists.  The NOT EXIST operation returns true if the file does not exist.

   If the comparative expression is true, the associated actions are executed.
   If the expression is false, the actions have no effect.  Adding the "-I"
   switch causes the comparisons to be made case-insensitively.  Evaluation is
   strictly from left to right; embedded parentheses to change the evaluation
   order are not accepted.

   Typically, one quoted-string is a percent-enclosed substitution variable and
   the other is a literal string.  Comparisons are always textual, so, for
   example, "3" is not equal to "03".


   Implementation notes:

    1. For a true comparison, the action part of the IF command line is copied
       to a temporary buffer, and the break action pointer is set to point at
       the buffer.  This is done instead of simply setting "sim_brk_act" to
       "cptr" because the "memcpy" and "strncpy" functions that are used to copy
       each command into the command buffer produce implementation-defined
       results if the buffers overlap ("cptr" points into the command buffer, so
       "sim_brk_act" would be copying a command within the buffer to the start
       of the same buffer).

    2. An IF command may appear as an action within a breakpoint command or
       another IF command.  To support this, any actions of a true IF command
       are prefixed to any remaining breakpoint or IF actions by concatenating
       the two sets of actions in a temporary buffer.  Were this not done, the
       remaining actions would be lost when "sim_brk_act" is pointed at the new
       IF actions.

    3. Any unexecuted actions must be copied to a separate buffer before
       prefixing, as they will reside in the same buffer that will hold the
       prefix if they are the result of a prior IF command.

/* Execute the SET ENVIRONMENT command.

   This command processing routine adds a new SET ENVIRONMENT command to create,

   processes commands of the form:

     SET ENVIRONMENT <name>=<value>
     SET ENVIRONMENT <name>=

   ...where <name> is the name of the variable, and value is the (unquoted)
   string value to be set.  If the value is missing, the variable is cleared.
   Legal names and values are host-system dependent.


   Implementation notes:

    1. MSVC does not offer the "setenv" function, so we use their "_putenv"
       function instead.  However, that function takes the full "name=value"
       string, rather than separate name and value parameters.

    2. We explicitly check for an equals sign before calling "get_glyph" because
       while that function will separate the name and value correctly at the
       equals sign, it will also allow the separation character to be a space.
       That would be confusing; for example, "SET ENV a b c" would set variable
       "a" to value "b c".

    3. While the 4.x version of the SET ENVIRONMENT processor calls "get_glyph",
       which forces all variable names to uppercase, the POSIX standard allows
       lowercase environment variable names and requires them to be distinct
       from uppercase names.  This can lead to unexpected behavior on POSIX
       systems.  Therefore, we call "get_glyph_nc" to preserve the case of the
       variable name.  Note that Windows treats environment variable names
       case-insensitively, so this change only affects POSIX systems.

     SET CONSOLE CONCURRENT
     SET CONSOLE NOCONCURRENT
     SET CONSOLE SERIAL ...
     SET CONSOLE NOSERIAL

   It also intercepts the SET CONSOLE TELNET command to close an existing serial
   connection if a Telnet connection is being established.

   Because the SET CONSOLE command accepts a comma-separated set of options, we
   must parse each option and decide whether it is a standard option or an
   extension option.


   Implementation notes:

    1. We parse each option without case conversion and then separate the option
       name from its value, if present, with conversion to upper case.  This is
       necessary because the option name must be uppercase to match the command
       table, but the option value might be case-sensitive, such as a serial
       port name.

    2. The SET CONSOLE LOG/NOLOG and SET CONSOLE DEBUG/NODEBUG commands print
       messages to report logging initiation or completion.  When executing
       command files, we normally suppress messages by setting "sim_quiet" to 1.
       However, the console messages are useful even in a command-file setting,
       so we restore the saved setting before calling the SET processor.  This
       is redundant but causes no harm if a command file is not executing.

   are either omitted or matches the type of the string breakpoint. In practice,
   this means that string breakpoints could be displayed for these commands:

     SHOW BREAK { ALL }
     SHOW -T BREAK { ALL }
     SHOW -T <other-types> BREAK { ALL }

   Persistent string breakpoints are displayed only with the first form.  All
   three forms will display temporary string breakpoints.  But a SHOW -N BREAK
   command would not display any string breakpoints because none have an "N"
   type.

   The ALL keyword is redundant but is accepted for compatibility with the
   standard SHOW BREAK command.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The matching string is stored in the breakpoint structure in decoded
       form, i.e., control characters are stored explicitly rather than as a
       character escape.  So the string must be encoded for display.

/* Execute the SHOW CONSOLE command.

   This command processing routine enhances the existing SHOW CONSOLE command to
   add configuration displays for concurrent command execution and serial port
   support.  The routine processes commands of the form:

     SHOW CONSOLE CONCURRENT
     SHOW CONSOLE SERIAL

   It also intercepts the SHOW CONSOLE TELNET command to convert it from a
   two-state report (i.e., connected to Telnet or console window) to a
   three-state report (Telnet, serial, or console window).

   Because the SHOW CONSOLE command accepts a comma-separated set of options, we
   must parse each option and decide whether it is a standard option or an
   extension option.


   Implementation notes:

    1. We parse each option without case conversion and then separate the option
       name from its value, if present, with conversion to upper case.  This is
       necessary because the option name must be uppercase to match the command
       table, but the option value might be case-sensitive, such as a serial
       port name.

    2. For the SHOW CONSOLE command with no specified options (i.e., SHOW ALL),
       we cannot simply call the standard "sim_show_console" routine to display
       the base set of values because it calls "sim_show_telnet", which displays
       "Connected to console window" if no Telnet connection exists.  This is
       incorrect if a serial connection exists.  Instead, we call that routine
       with a command line consisting of all options except the TELNET option.
       In that way, we get the base display and can then add our own line for
       the Telnet/serial/window connection.

       If the base set of options is changed, we must also change the "show_set"
       value below to match.

    3. For SHOW CONSOLE (i.e., SHOW ALL), we loop through the extension table to
       call the individual SHOW executors.  However, we don't want to call
       "ex_show_serial" twice, or we'll get the connection report twice, so we
       use the otherwise-unused "arg" values as a flag to skip the call, which
       we do after processing the table.

/* Execute the SHOW CONSOLE SERIAL/TELNET command.

   This command processing routine adds a new SHOW CONSOLE SERIAL command and
   enhances the existing SHOW CONSOLE TELNET command to display the connection
   status of the system console.  The routine processes commands of the form:

     SHOW CONSOLE SERIAL
     SHOW CONSOLE TELNET

   It is also called as part of the SHOW CONSOLE processing.  The three calls
   are differentiated by the value of the "flag" parameter, as follows:

     Flag     Meaning
     -------  -----------
     SH_SER   SHOW SERIAL
     SH_TEL   SHOW TELNET
     SH_NONE  SHOW

   For the SHOW SERIAL and SHOW TELNET commands, if the console is connected to
   the specified type of port, the port status (connection and transmit/receive
   counts) is printed.  Otherwise, the command simply reports the connection
   type.  So, for example, a SHOW SERIAL command reports "Connected to Telnet
   port" or "Connected to console window" if the console is not using a serial
   port.

   The plain SHOW command reports the port status of the connection in use.


   Implementation notes:

    1. We must duplicate the code from the "sim_show_telnet" routine in
       "sim_console.c" here because that routine reports a console window
       connection if Telnet is not used, and there is no way to suppress that
       report when a serial port is used.

/* Hooked command extension replacement routines */


/* Substitute arguments into a command line.

   This hook routine extends the standard "sub_args" routine to perform token
   substitution as well as parameter substitution.  The standard behavior
   substitutes parameter placeholders of the form "%n", where "n" is a digit
   from 0-9, with the strings pointed to by the corresponding elements in the
   supplied "args" array.

   In addition to the parameter substitution, built-in and environment tokens
   surrounded by percent signs are replaced.  These substitutions provide the
   value of environment variables, as well as the current date and time in
   various formats that may be used with the REPLY facility to set the target OS
   time on bootup.  They also provide some internal simulator values, such as
   the path to the binary and the current code version, that may be used in
   command files.

   The routine interprets these character sequences as follows:

     %0 - %9   =  parameter substitution from the supplied "args" array

     %token%   =  substitute a value corresponding to the predefined token

     %envvar%  =  substitute the value of an environment variable

     %%        =  substitute a literal percent sign

   Tokens consist of characters without intervening blanks.  For example,
   "%TOKEN%" is a token, but "100% PURE" is not (however, this should be
   represented as "100%% PURE" to designate the literal percent sign
   explicitly).  If a token or environment variable is not defined, it will be
   replaced with a null value.

   On entry, "iptr" points at the buffer containing the command line to scan for
   substitutions, "optr" points at a temporary output buffer of the same size
   as the input buffer, "bufsize" is the size of the buffers, and "args" points
   at an array of parameter substitution values.  On return, the "iptr" buffer
   contains the substituted line.  If substitution overflows the output buffer,
   the result will be truncated at "bufsize" characters with no error
   indication.

   This routine is also called for commands entered at the simulation console in
   addition to those appearing in command files.  The numeric arguments in the

    1. A literal percent sign is designated by a pair of percent signs (i.e.,
       "%%").  This change from the earlier practice of using a backslash as the
       escape character is for compatibility with version 4.x.

    2. The C "str..." functions offer no performance advantage over inline code
       and are used for clarity only.

    3. If supplied, the "args" array must contain 10 elements.  If "args" is
       NULL, then parameter substitution will not occur.

/* Get a specified radix from the command-line switches or keyword.

   This hook routine extends the standard "sim_get_radix" routine to permit a
   request for binary interpretation of numeric data.  The standard behavior
   permits commands such as EXAMINE to override the default radix of the data
   item by specifying one of the following switches on the command line:

     Switch  Interpretation
     ------  -------------------
       -O    An octal value
       -D    A decimal value
       -H    A hexadecimal value

    ...and to set the default radix for a device with these commands:

      Command            Interpretation
      -----------------  -------------------
      SET <dev> OCTAL    An octal value
      SET <dev> DECIMAL  A decimal value
      SET <dev> HEX      A hexadecimal value

    This routine extends the interpretation to add -B and SET <dev> BINARY for
    binary value interpretations.

    On entry, if the "cptr" parameter is non-null, then it points at the keyword
    for a SET <dev> command.  If the keyword is "BINARY", the returned radix is
    2.  Otherwise, it is 0 to indicate that the keyword was not understood by
    this routine.

    Otherwise, the "cptr" parameter is NULL, and the "switches" parameter is
    checked for the presence of the O, D, H, or B flags.  If one is present, the
    corresponding radix is returned.  Otherwise, the "default_radix" parameter
    value is returned.


    Implementation notes:

     1. The order of switch interpretation matches that of the standard SCP
        routine, so that the same precedence is used when multiple conflicting
        switches are present.

     2. This must be implemented as an extension, as several simulators already
        use -B for their own purposes (e.g., for the PDP11, it indicates a byte
        access).

/* Local SCP command extension routines */


/* Execute commands in a text file.

   This routine is called to execute the SCP commands present in a text file.
   It is called by the CALL and DO command executors, where it processes
   commands of the form:

     DO { <switches> } <filename> { <param 1> { <param 2> { ... <param 9> } } }

   The <filename> must be present.  Up to nine optional parameters may be
   specified, which may be referenced within the command file with the
   substitutions "%1" through "%9", respectively.  If a parameter is omitted,
   the corresponding substitution will be the empty string.  Parameters are
   normally delimited by spaces.  However, spaces may be embedded in a parameter
   if it is quoted, either with single (') or double (") quote marks.  The
   starting and ending quotes must match, or an "Invalid argument" error is
   indicated.

   Three optional switches are recognized:

     -E = continue execution in the presence of errors
     -V = echo each command line as it is executed
     -A = echo all simulation stop and ATTACH/DETACH messages

   The -E switch causes command file execution to continue regardless of any
   error conditions.  If -E is present, only EXIT or an ASSERT failure will stop
   execution.  Without -E, execution stops if a command returns an SCP error.

   Specifying the -V switch will print each command line before it is executed.
   The filename containing the command is printed as a prompt, e.g.:

     cmdfile> echo Hello!

   If -V is absent, then the command line is printed only if the command fails.
   Simulation stops, including the expiration of a STEP command, are not
   considered errors and so do not cause the associated commands to be printed.

   The -A switch causes all simulation stops and messages from the ATTACH and
   DETACH commands to be reported.  In its absence, the "Breakpoint" and "Step
   expired" messages that would normally be printed in response to the
   associated stop condition are suppressed, as are the informational messages
   from ATTACH and DETACH, such as "Creating new file."  This provides a cleaner
   console display log when automated prompts and responses are used.  As an
   example, if "cmdfile" contains:

     GO UNTIL "Memory size? " ; ATTACH -N MS0 new.tape ; REPLY "1024\r" ; GO

   ...then "DO cmdfile" would display:

     Memory size? 1024

   ...whereas "DO -A cmdfile" would display:

     Memory size?
     Breakpoint, P: 37305 (CLF 10)
     MS: creating new file
     1024

   All three switches propagate from top-level command files to nested files.
   For example, invoking a top-level command file with "DO -V" will verbosely
   list not only that file's commands but also the commands within any DO files
   invoked therein.

   On entry, the "cptr" parameter points at the invocation string after the DO
   or CALL keyword (i.e., points at the optional switches or command filename).
   The "file" parameter is NULL if the routine is to open the filename present
   at the start of the "cptr" string or is a file stream pointer to an open
   file.  The "flag" parameter indicates the source of the call and nesting
   level and contains one of these values:

     < 0 = global or local initialization file (no error if not found)
       0 = startup command line file
       1 = "DO" command
     > 1 = nested DO or CALL command

   For a nested command call, the parameter contains the nesting level in bits
   0-3 and the value of the invoking switches in bits 4-29.

   The routine begins by separating the nesting level from the propagated
   switches.  If the nesting level is too deep, the routine returns with an
   error.

   It then obtains any switches specified on the command line and merges them
   into the propagated switches.  Then it separates the command line parameters,
   removing any leading or trailing spaces (unless the parameter is quoted).  If
   the "file" parameter is NULL, it then attempts to open the specified command
   file.  If the open fails, and this is not an initialization file request,
   then the attempt is repeated after appending the ".sim" extension to the
   specified name.  If this second attempt also fails, the command fails with a
   "File open error" message.

   The routine then enters the command loop.  The next command line is obtained,
   either from a pending breakpoint action or from the command file, and
   argument substitutions are made.  If the end of the file was reached, the
   loop exits with success status.  Otherwise, if the resulting line is empty
   (e.g., is a blank or comment line), the loop continues with the next command
   line.

   If the line contains a command, it is echoed if the -V switch was present.
   If it's a label line, it is ignored, and the loop continues.  Otherwise, the
   global switches are cleared, and the "sim_quiet" value is set if neither the
   -A (audible) nor -V (verbose) switch was specified.  This suppresses certain
   noise messages unless they were specifically requested by the invocation.
   Then the command keyword is parsed, and the action routine is obtained.

   If it is a DO command, the DO executor is called with the nesting level
   increased by one.  On reentry here, the nesting level is checked, and an
   error occurs if the limit is exceeded.

   If the command is RUN (or any of the execution commands), and neither the
   -A nor -V switches was specified, the SIM_SW_HIDE switch will be passed to
   the RUN executor to suppress BREAK and STEP messages.  Then the associated
   command handler is invoked, and its status result is obtained.

   If the command is one of those restricted to use within a command file (CALL,
   RETURN, GOTO, or ABORT), the appropriate action is taken.  Otherwise, if the
   command succeeds, the command loop continues.  If the command fails, actions
   then depend on the specific error code and switch settings.  Three
   determinations are made: whether command file execution continues, whether
   the command line is printed, and whether the error message text is printed.

   Execution stays in the command loop if the error is not due to an EXIT or
   ABORT command or an ASSERT failure -- these always terminate DO execution --
   and the code is for a simulation stop (all VM-defined status codes and the
   STEP expired code) or the -E switch was specified.  That is, the loop
   terminates for an EXIT, ABORT, ASSERT that fails, or an SCP error and the -E
   switch was not given.

   The failing command line is printed if an SCP error occurred, the -V switch
   was not given, and the command was not DO unless it failed because the file
   could not be opened.  This excludes simulator stops, which are not considered
   errors in a command file.  it also avoids printing the line a second time if
   it was previously printed by the -V switch.  Finally, because the status of a
   failing command is passed back as the status of the enclosing DO or CALL
   command to ensure that execution stops for a failure in a nested invocation,
   the command line is not printed unless the DO command itself failed.  This
   determination is made independently of the determination to stay, because we
   want command lines causing errors to be printed, regardless of whether or not
   we will ignore the error.

   The error text is printed if it is an SCP error and either the command file
   is nested or the error will be ignored.  Simulation stops have already been
   printed by the "fprint_stopped" call in the RUN handler, and if the DO
   command was initiated from the command line and not by a nested DO or CALL
   invocation, and the execution loop will be exited, then the main command loop
   will print the error text when this routine returns.

   Finally, we call the VM's post-command handler if it is defined and check for
   a CTRL+C stop.  If it is detected, a message is printed, any pending
   breakpoint actions are cleared, and the status return is set to propagate the
   abort back through all nesting levels.

   Once the command loop exits, either for an error, or because the command file
   is exhausted, the file is closed if we had opened it, and the last command
   status is returned as the status of the invoking DO or CALL.  If we will be
   exiting the simulator, the end-of-session detach for all units is performed
   before returning, so that the same quietness as was used for the attaches is
   used.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The nesting limit is arbitrary and is intended mainly to prevent a stack
       overflow abort if a command file executes a recursive DO in an infinite
       loop.  Note that CALL invocations count toward the nesting limit.  Note
       also that four bits of the "flag" parameter are allocated to the nesting
       level, so the limit must be less than 15.

    2. The command line switches are not extracted here when processing the
       initialization or command-line files.  This is because the switches were
       already processed and stripped in the "main" routine before we were
       called.

    3. The standard ATTACH and DETACH commands are too noisy for command-file
       execution.  Specifically, ATTACH reports "unit is read only" for files
       without write permission, "creating new file" for newly created
       files, and "buffering file in memory" when the unit has the UNIT_BUFABLE
       flag.  DETACH reports "writing buffer to file" for a unit with
       UNIT_BUFABLE.  All of the messages report conditions over which the user
       of an executing command file has no control.

    4. The "do_arg" array is an array of string pointers, rather than an array
       of strings, that point into the command line buffer that is passed to
       this routine.  That buffer must not be constant, as we separate the
       parameters by writing a NUL after each parsed parameter.

    5. The command file is opened as a binary, rather than text, file on Windows
       systems.  This is because "fgetpos" and "fsetpos" (used in the CALL
       executor) fail to work properly on text files.  Opening as binary means
       that lines obtained with "fgets" have trailing CRLFs instead of LFs, but
       the "read_line" routine strips both line termination characters, so the
       result is as expected.

    6. The HP simulators look for SIM_SW_HIDE in "sim_switches" and return
       SCPE_OK status in lieu of the SCPE_STEP or STOP_BRKPNT codes.  In turn,
       this suppresses the "Step expired" and "Breakpoint" simulation stop
       messages that otherwise would be interspersed with prompts and responses
       supplied by the GO UNTIL and REPLY commands.

    7. Execution commands are identified by the "help_base" field of their
       corresponding CTAB entries being non-null.  This is a hack; see the
       comments for the "ex_cmds" structure declaration for details.

    8. A failing command within a command file returns an error status that
       causes the bad command to be echoed to identify the cause of the error.
       That status is also returned as the command file execution status, which
       would normally cause the invoking DO or CALL command to be echoed as
       well.  This is undesirable, as the command file name has already been
       printed as part of the echo, so this is suppressed.

       An exception is made for the SCPE_OPENERR status returned when the DO
       command file cannot be opened; otherwise, there would be no indication
       what caused the error message.  However, when this status is passed back
       to nested invocations, the exception would cause each invoking DO command
       to be listed, which would be wrong (the outer DOs did not fail with file
       open errors).

       To fix this, we tag the innermost nested return only with SCPE_DOFAILED,
       and use this to implement the exception.  This suppresses the propagating
       errors, so that only the DO command that actually encountered the file
       open error is echoed.

    9. The CALL command currently does not take switches (they aren't parsed
       from the command line string), so the called context uses the same switch
       environment as the caller.

/* Execute the GOTO command.

   This routine is called to process a GOTO command within a command file.  The
   command form is:

     GOTO <label>

   Where:

     <label> is an identifier that appears in a label statement somewhere within
             the current command file.

   This routine transfers command file execution to the labeled statement
   specified by the "cptr" parameter by positioning the file specified by the
   "stream" parameter to the line following the label.  On entry, "cptr" points
   at the remainder of the GOTO command line, which should contain a transfer
   label.  If it is missing or is followed by additional characters, "Too few
   arguments" or "Too many arguments" errors are returned.  Otherwise, a search
   for the label is performed by rewinding the file stream and reading lines
   until either the label is found or the EOF is reached.  In the latter case,
   an "Invalid argument" error is returned.


   Implementation notes:

    1. A colon preceding the specified label is ignored.  Either "GOTO :label"
       or "GOTO label" is accepted.

    2. A simple linear search from the start of the file is performed.  Most
       labels will follow their GOTOs in the file, but optimizing the search
       into two parts (i.e., from the current point to the end, and then from
       the start to the current point) isn't worth the complexity.

    3. The search is case-sensitive.

/* Execute the CALL command.

   This routine is called to process a CALL command within a command file.  The
   command form is:

     CALL <label> { <param 1> { <param 2> { ... <param 9> } } }

   Where:

     <label> is an identifier that appears in a label statement somewhere within
             the current command file.

   This routine saves the current position in the file specified by the "stream"
   parameter and then transfers command file execution to the labeled statement
   specified by the "cptr" parameter by positioning the file to the line
   following the label.  If positioning succeeds, the commands there are
   executed until a RETURN or ABORT command is executed, or the end of the
   command file is reached.  At that point, the original position is restored,
   and the command file continues to execute at the line after the original CALL
   command.

   On entry, "cptr" points at the remainder of the CALL command line, which
   should contain a transfer label.  The "filename" parameter points to the the
   name of the current command file, "level" is set to the current nesting
   level, and "switches" contain the set of switches that were used to invoke
   the current command file.  These three parameters are used to set up the same
   command file environment for subroutine execution.

   If the transfer label is missing, "Too few arguments" status is returned.
   Otherwise, the current stream position is saved, and the "goto_label" routine
   is called to position the stream to the start of the subroutine.  If that
   routine succeeds, the current filename is copied into a parameter buffer,
   followed by the remainder of the CALL command line parameters.  The switches
   are reset, and the "execute_file" routine is called to execute the
   subroutine.  On return, the file position is restored, and the execution
   status is returned.


   Implementation notes:

    1.  The "execute_file" routine parses the command line for switches and the
        command filename, which must be the "zeroth" parameter.  We must supply
        these so that the subroutine executes in the same environment as the
        containing command file, except that the parameters to the subroutine
        are set to those passed in the CALL command rather than from the
        original parameters to the command file invocation.

    2. The saved file position is the line after the CALL statement, which is
       where the called subroutine will return.

/* Replace a predefined token.

   This routine replaces a predefined token with its associated value.  Token
   references are character strings surrounded by percent signs ("%") and not
   containing blanks.  For example, "%token%" is a token reference, but "%not a
   token%" is not.

   On entry, "token_ptr" points at a valid token reference, "out_ptr" points at
   a pointer to the buffer where the associated value is to be placed, and
   "out_size" points at the size of the output buffer.  The token is obtained by
   stripping the percent signs and converting to upper case.  The keyword table
   is then searched for a match for the token.  If it is found, the associated
   substitution action directs the generation of the returned value.

   For date and time values, the current time (or a time rescaled to the 20th
   century) is formatted as directed by the keyword entry.  Other values are
   generally static and are copied to the output buffer.  After copying, the
   output pointer is advanced over the value, and the buffer size is decreased
   appropriately.


   Implementation notes:

    1. We get the current local time unconditionally, as most of the token
       substitutions requested will be for date or time values.

    2. The "token_ptr" cannot be "const" because the "get_glyph" routine takes a
       variable input parameter, even though it is not modified.

    3. If insufficient space remains in the output buffer, the "strftime"
       routine return 0 and leaves the buffer in an indeterminate state.  In
       this case, we store a NUL at the start of the buffer to ensure that the
       buffer is properly terminated.

    4. The SIM_MAJOR value is a constant and so cannot be the target of the
       "ptr" field.  Therefore, we must declare a variable that is set to this
       value and point at that.

    5. "sim_prog_name" is a pointer to the program name, rather than the program
       name string itself.  So the associated "ptr" field is a pointer to a
       pointer to the name.

    6. The "copy_string" routine updates its output pointer and size
       parameters, so we avoid updating them again when that routine is called.

/* Copy a string without overrun.

   This routine copies a string to a buffer while ensuring that the buffer does
   not overflow.  On entry, "source" points to the string to copy, "source_size"
   is zero if the entire string is to be copied or a positive value if only a
   leading substring is to be copied, "target" points at a pointer to the target
   buffer, and "target_size" points at the size of the buffer.

   If "source_size" is zero, the string length is obtained.  If the source
   length is greater than the space available in the target buffer, the length
   is reduced to match the space available.  Then the string is copied.  The
   target buffer pointer is updated, and a NUL is appended to terminate the
   string.  Finally, the buffer size is decreased by the size of the copied
   string.


   Implementation notes:

    1. This routine is needed because the standard "strncpy" function does not
       guarantee that a NUL is appended.  Also, if space is available, the
       remainder of the output buffer is filled with NULs, which is unnecessary
       for our use.

/* Parse a quoted string.

   A string delimited by single or double quotation marks is parsed from the
   buffer pointed to by the "sptr" parameter and copied into the buffer pointed
   to by the "dptr" parameter.  These specialized escapes are decoded and
   replaced with the indicated substitutions:

        \"         "
        \'         '
        \\         \
        \r         CR
        \n         LF

   In addition, a backslash followed by exactly three octal digits is replaced
   with the corresponding ASCII code.  The opening and closing quotes are not
   copied, but any escaped embedded quotes are.  All other characters are copied
   verbatim, except that lowercase alphabetic characters are replaced with
   uppercase characters if the "upshift" parameter is TRUE.

   The function returns a pointer to the next character in the source buffer
   after the closing quotation mark.  If the opening and closing quotation marks
   are not the same or the closing quotation mark is missing, the function
   returns NULL.


   Implementation notes:

    1. The routine assumes that the first "sptr" character is the opening quote,
       and it is this character that will be sought as the closing quote.  It is
       not necessary to escape the alternate quote character if it appears in
       the string.  For example, "It's great!" and 'Say "Hi"' are accepted as
       legal.

   converted to a number.  If the value does not parse, SCPE_ARG status is

/* Encode a string for printing.

   This routine encodes a string containing control characters into the
   equivalent escaped form, surrounded by quote marks.  On entry, "source"
   points at the string to encode.  Embedded quotes and control characters are
   replaced with their escaped counterparts.  The return value points at an
   internal static buffer containing the encoded string, as the routine is
   intended to be called from a print function and so used immediately.

   The supported escapes are the same as those parsed for quoted strings.


   Implementation notes:

    1. To avoid dealing with buffer overflows, we declare an output buffer large
       enough to accommodate the largest decoded input string.  This would be a
       string where each character is a control character requiring four
       encoding characters in the output buffer (plus three more for the
       surrounding quotes and the trailing NUL).  Consequently, we need not
       check for the end of the buffer while encoding.
