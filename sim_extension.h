/* Extension remappings.

   These remappings cause the insertion of shims when a VM being compiled
   includes this declaration module.  The shims are not wanted when compiling
   the extension module itself.


   Implementation notes:

    1. When the extensions are being compiled, the module includes the
       "sim_serial.h" file, which includes the "sim_rs232.h" file.  Therefore,
       we do not want to include the latter file a second time and so exclude
       it when compiling the extensions module.
